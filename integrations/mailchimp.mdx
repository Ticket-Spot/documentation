Connect your **Mailchimp** account with **Ticket Spot** to automatically add event attendees to your Mailchimp audience and email marketing campaigns.  
This integration allows you to manage audience lists, automate communications, and track attendee engagement directly from your Mailchimp dashboard.

- ✅ An active **[Ticket Spot](https://ticketspotapp.com/)** account with access to the **Integrations** page.  
- ✅ A valid **[Mailchimp](https://login.mailchimp.com/)** account with an API key generated. Follow the guide: **[How to Generate a Mailchimp API Key](https://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/guides/quick-start/)** to create one.
