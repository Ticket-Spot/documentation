Organizers can easily import their existing **Eventbrite** events and tickets into **Ticket Spot** while transitioning to our fee-free platform. This integration lets you manage all your events in one place, without switching between multiple platforms.

Let’s get started 🚀


## Prerequisites

Before setting up the integration, make sure you have:

- ✅ An active **[Ticket Spot](https://ticketspotapp.com/)** account with access to the **Integrations** page.
- ✅ An active **[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/blogquick-start-guide/)** organizer account to authorize and import your events.


## Integration

**Step 1:** Log in to your **Ticket Spot** account and click on the **Integrations** tab from the top navigation bar to open the integrations page.
