Organizers can host and manage virtual **Zoom** events directly from their **Ticket Spot** dashboard. After successful integration between Zoom and Ticket Spot, you can automatically create Zoom meetings for your events, eliminating the need to switch between multiple platforms.

Let's get started🚀


## Prerequisites

Before setting up the integration, make sure you have:

- ✅ An active **[Ticket Spot](https://ticketspotapp.com/)** account with access to the **Integrations** page.
- ✅ An active **[Zoom](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0061316)** account to authorize and manage your virtual meetings.


## Integration

**Step 1:** Log in to your **Ticket Spot** account and click on the **Integrations** tab from the top navigation bar to open the integrations page.

## List Zoom Events

When enabled, **Ticket Spot** displays your upcoming Zoom meetings and webinars so you can link or use them directly for your events. When disabled, Ticket Spot does not show your existing Zoom meetings, but you can still add new Zoom links manually if needed.
