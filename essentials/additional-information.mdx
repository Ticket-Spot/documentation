The **Additional Information** step allows you to collect extra details from attendees during registration. You can add custom RSVP (Response Status) questions to gather any information needed for planning or organizing your event.  

Use **Quick Add** to insert common questions instantly, or choose A**dd Custom Question** to create your own. This helps you control exactly what information you collect from attendees.

Let’s get started 🚀

## Adding Your First Question

You can start collecting attendee information by adding your first question to the form. You can either choose a pre-built question using **Quick Add** or create your own using **Add Custom Question**.

### Add Custom Question

1. Click on the **Add Custom Questions** button to create your own RSVP question.
