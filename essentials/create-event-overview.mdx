## Publishing Your Event

After completing all event setup steps, review your event details and click **Publish Event**. Publishing makes your event visible to attendees across your site, widgets, and any shared links.

You can also preview exactly how the event will look on your site—just click **Event Page** or copy the event site link to see the live view before sharing it with attendees.
