Once you’ve configured your **Email Communication** settings, the next step is to set up the **Waitlist**. This feature helps you manage attendee demand even after your event reaches full capacity. When enabled, interested attendees can join a waitlist to be notified if additional tickets become available — ensuring you never miss potential registrations.

Let’s get started 🚀

## Settings
The Settings section lets you control when and how the waitlist is displayed to attendees.

| S.no | Field | Description|
|------|-------|------------|
| 1.    | Enable Waitlist | Toggle this option to allow attendees to join a waitlist when tickets are sold out or the event has reached capacity. Once enabled, additional configuration options become available. |
| 2.   | Show When Tickets Sold Out   | Enable this toggle to display the waitlist option as soon as all tickets for the event are sold out.                                                                                            |
| 3.    | Show When Event at Capacity  | Enable this toggle to display the waitlist option when the total event capacity (across all tickets) is reached.                                                                                |
| 4.    | Call to Action               | Enter the text that will appear on the button attendees click to join the waitlist. Keep it short and clear — for example, **Join Waitlist** or **Notify Me*.                                      |
| 5.    | Description                  | Provide a brief message explaining how the waitlist works. You can personalize this message using available tokens (e.g., `attendee_first_name`).                                              |
| 6.    | Confirmation Message         | Add the message that will appear on-screen after an attendee successfully joins the waitlist. This confirmation is shown instantly, but is not sent via email.

## Communications
The Communications section lets you automate and personalize the messages (via email) sent to attendees who interact with your waitlist — whether they’ve just joined it or have been offered a spot when one becomes available.  

There are two email templates available:

- **Spot Available Notification**: Sent when a spot opens up, inviting the attendee to claim it.
- **Waitlist Confirmation Email**: Sent immediately after someone joins the waitlist to confirm their submission.

> **Info**: You can enable either (or both) templates as needed.

### Spot Available Notification

This template notifies attendees when a spot becomes available for your event, inviting them to claim it within a specified time frame. You can enable this template using the toggle switch and customize the message content to ensure it matches your event’s tone and urgency.  

Click the **Spot Available Notification** template, and a customization panel opens on the right-hand side of the interface, allowing you to configure all message details.

| **Field**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Subject**     | Add the subject line for your message. Combine regular text with tokens for personalization — for example, “A Spot Just Opened for `event_title`!”.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Message Body**| Write your email content here. You can include personalization tokens like `attendee_first_name`, `attendee_email`, and `event_title` to make your message feel personal and relevant.                                                                                                    |

### Notifying Waitlist Attendees

Once a ticket becomes available, you can notify attendees who are on the waitlist and allow them to claim the spot. Here’s how to notify your guests:

1. Choose the attendees from the list, or use the search and filter options to select those you want to notify about the available ticket, and click on the **Notify Guests**.

![notifying-waitlist-attendees](../assets/create-events/waitlist/notifying-waitlist-attendees.gif)

2. Click on the **Customize Email Template** button if you wish to send a personalized message to the attendee.

![cust-email-template](../assets/create-events/waitlist/cust-email-template.gif)

3. Click on the **Send Notification** button. A confirmation email will be sent to the attendee, allowing them to claim the available ticket.

![send-notification](../assets/create-events/waitlist/send-notification.png)

You can check the status of the attendee, which will change from **Pending** to **Notified** once the notification has been sent.

![status-notification](../assets/create-events/waitlist/status-notified.png)

By using this process, you ensure timely and efficient communication with your waitlisted guests, providing them with the opportunity to claim available spots before they are offered to others.

### Delete Attendee from Waitlist

To remove an attendee from the waitlist, simply find the attendee in the list and click **Delete** next to their name. This will permanently remove them from the waitlist, and they will no longer be notified if a spot becomes available.

### View Attendee Analytics

You can manage attendee details and track important metrics such as how many tickets have been sold. You can also view check-ins, add new attendees, and analyze the status of each attendee, ensuring smooth event management.
