The **Viewing Your Tickets** feature allows attendees to access and manage their event tickets through the **TicketSpot Attendee Portal**. From the dashboard, users can view ticket details, download ticket PDFs, cancel or transfer a ticket, and contact the organizer directly for assistance. All upcoming and past events are displayed in one centralized view, making it easy to manage bookings and event access efficiently.
