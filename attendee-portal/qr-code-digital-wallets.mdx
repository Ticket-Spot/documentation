> **Note:** Each ticket has a unique QR code. Once scanned at the event check-in, it can’t be reused. Make sure to present the correct QR code for each attendee to avoid access issues.

## Digital Wallet

The **Digital Wallet** feature makes it easier to access your tickets during check-in. After viewing your QR code, you can save the ticket to your mobile wallet for quick and reliable access at the venue — even without an internet connection.  

Both Google Pay and Apple Wallet provide offline access to tickets, event reminders, and quick ticket display from your phone’s lock screen or notifications for quick and easy entry.
