Let’s get started 🚀

## Understanding Billing Dashboard

### 1. Current Plan

At the top of the page, you’ll see your current plan details inside a green box.  
It includes:

- Your current plan name (e.g., **Free Plan**)
- A short description of your plan’s benefits
- A button labeled **Explore Plans**, which takes you to view all available upgrades

> **Example:** You’re on the Free Plan. Upgrade to unlock powerful features like unlimited events, advanced analytics, email automation, and custom branding.

### 2. Available Subscription Plans

You will see four plans displayed:

- Free  
- Professional  
- Business  
- Enterprise  

Each plan lists its features, ticket and email limits, and pricing.

You can toggle between **Monthly** and **Yearly** billing options using the switch at the top.
