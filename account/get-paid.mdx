The **Get Paid** feature helps you connect a payment provider to start accepting payments for your events. Once connected, all ticket sales are processed securely, and the money you earn is automatically sent to your account — no manual transfers needed.

Let’s get started 🚀

## Connect a Payment Provider

1. Log in to your **Ticket Spot** account, click on your **Profile icon** in the top-right corner, and select **Get Paid** from the dropdown menu.
