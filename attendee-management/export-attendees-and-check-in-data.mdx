title: "Export Attendees and Check-In Data"
---

When you **export attendee** data, you get a complete record of registrations, attendance, and event activity. This gives you clear visibility into who joined and how they interacted and helps with verification, reporting, order checking, and maintaining accurate event documentation.


Once generated, the export downloads automatically. You can review it, store it, or import it into your CRM or analytics tools to support post-event follow-ups and streamline your internal workflows.


Let’s get started 🚀


**Step 1**: Log in to your Ticket Spot account, then click the Attendee icon next to the event you want to export attendee data for.

|------|--------|-------------|------------------------------|
| 1. | **Export Attendees Data** | Downloads attendee information for the selected event. | Generates a file with all attendee details currently visible in the dashboard. |
| 2. | **Export Check-In Activity** | Downloads detailed check-in activity records. | Includes each check-in action with timestamps and operator details. |
| 3. | **Export All Attendees** | Toggles between exporting only filtered attendees or exporting everyone. | When ON, all attendees are exported, even if filters are applied (e.g., “VIP only”). |
