You can **manually add attendees** to any event in **Ticket Spot** whenever you need to register someone yourself—whether they signed up offline, were added by your team, or require a custom ticket entry. This guide walks you through each step of the process so you can quickly enter attendee details and keep your event list up to date.


Let’s get started 🚀


**Step 1**: Log in to your Ticket Spot account, then click the Attendee icon next to the event where you want to add attendees.
