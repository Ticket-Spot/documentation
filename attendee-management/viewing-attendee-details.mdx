**Viewing attendee details** allows event teams to access complete information about each attendee. This includes registration data, ticket type, order information, check-in status, and any custom fields collected during registration. Having this information available in one place helps with event coordination, attendee verification, and resolving on-site queries.

Let’s get started 🚀


**Step 1**: Log in to your **Ticket Spot** account, then click on the **Attendee** icon next to the event you want to export attendee data for.
