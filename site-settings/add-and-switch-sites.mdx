If you manage multiple sites, switching between them—or creating a new one—keeps your workspace organized and helps you move quickly between different event setups. From the site dropdown menu, you can jump to another site or add a brand-new one in just a few clicks. This guide walks you through how to do it smoothly.

Let’s get started 🚀

## Add a New Site

Creating a new site allows you to manage additional event pages within your TicketSpot account. Whether you're hosting a new event or setting up a different site, this process ensures seamless organization.

**Step 1:** Click on the **site name** in the top-left corner, open the dropdown menu, and select **+ Add New Site** to start adding a new site.

A modal window will appear where you can **Create or Connect Your Site.**

### Create Your Site
