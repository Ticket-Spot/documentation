The **Event Submissions** feature allows users to submit events for your approval, enabling you to create a marketplace for event organizers. Once submitted, events undergo a review process before being published, giving you control over the content on your platform.  

By enabling **Public Event Submissions**, users can create and submit events, and you can review and approve them before they go live, ensuring only approved events are published.

Let’s get started 🚀


**Step 1**: Log in to your **Ticket Spot** account and click on the **Event Submissions** option from the top navigation bar.

_**Example:**_ Event Under Review: `event_title`

2. **Email Message:** Customize the notification message that informs users their event is under review: 

**Example:**_ "Your event, `event_title`, is currently under review. We will notify you once it's been approved."

## Marketplace Commission Fees

This section allows you to configure commission fees charged to event organizers using your marketplace platform. You can choose between a Fixed Percentage Rate or Tiered Percentage Rates based on sale amounts, helping you optimize your revenue while keeping fees competitive.

### Fixed Percentage Rate

The **Fixed Percentage Rate** option charges a consistent commission rate on all sales. This rate will be applied to every sale, regardless of the amount.

**Commission Percentage:**  
Enter the desired percentage (e.g., 8%). For example, with an 8% commission, you earn $8 on every $100 sale.

### Tiered Percentage Rates

The **Tiered Percentage Rates** option allows you to set different commission rates based on the sale amount. Higher tiers typically have lower rates to encourage larger transactions. This feature gives you flexibility in charging event organizers depending on how much they sell.

![tiered-percentage-rates](../assets/site-settings/event-submissions/tiered-percentage-rates.png)

**Setting up tiers:**  

1. Click the **Add Tier** button to add additional tiers as needed, each with its own sale range and commission rate.

![click-add-tier-btn](../assets/site-settings/event-submissions/click-add-tier-btn.png)

Set different commission rates based on sale amounts. Typically, higher tiers have lower rates to encourage larger transactions.

- **Min Amount ($):** The minimum sale amount for this tier.
- **Max Amount ($):** The maximum sale amount for this tier.

Once you enter these values, the **Commission (%)** is automatically calculated based on the Max Amount ($).

**Example:**_ If you set tiers like **$0–$50 (5%)** and **$51–$100 (8%)**, a $75 sale would generate a $6.00 commission (8% of $75).

Click the **Add Tier** button to add more tiers with different sale ranges and commission rates as needed.

> **Important:** **Commission fees** are **automatically calculated** and **deducted** from event **organizer payouts**. These settings apply to all new event submissions. Ensure your fee structure is competitive and clearly communicated to attract quality event organizers.
