Managing invitations helps you control access, update roles, or remove users who haven’t joined yet. Each pending or active team member has a menu where you can take quick actions such as updating their role, resending their invite, or removing them from your team.

Let’s get started 🚀


**Step 1**: Log in to your **Ticket Spot** account and click on the **Invite Team** tab from the top navigation bar to open the team management page.

**Step 2**:Select the invitation you want to manage and click the vertical ellipsis (⋮) next to it to open the available actions.

## Change Role
Select **Change Role** to update the team member’s access. This option lets you assign a new role if their responsibilities change or if they need more (or less) permission within your Ticket Spot account.

1. Select **Change Role** from the list of options to update the member’s access level.
